## Project Detail
i have divided project into two branches in main and dev 

in main branch code functionality are working with API like filter and pagination working on server side 

In this project i have create two routes first is User listing and Second is User Detail.

I have used MUI for Styling

I have used table for listing user and add a button to show detail rather then clicking on row to make UI better and add filter and search

i used custom hook to call API and other handler like filter user on the basis of gender and saerch

i used context API to persist the filter

I don't use Redux as it is not mention in the requirements

I have added Flag on the basis of user country in user detail page

I have also added google map
